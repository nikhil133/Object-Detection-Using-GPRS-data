# Object-Detection-Using-GPRS-data
Detecting the object automaticaly on the basis of dielectric constant and pattern 

## About
This is an automated oject tracking tool burried under the ground.
<p> It analysis the GPR data which is in 3dr format which is read into using HDF5 file format.</p>
<p> Multiple image processing algorithm and machine learning technique has been used such as:</p>

## Image processing Algorithms:
* Normalization
* Gaussian Filter
* Sobel Edge Detector
* Convolution
* Column and Row clustering algorithm
* Adaptive threshold

## Machine Learning Technique
* Pattern feed
* Pattern Correlation basis on maximum data point match
